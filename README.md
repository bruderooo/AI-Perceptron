## How the program works?
#### 1. In file rand.py generate two lists randome numbers from -5 to 5 (x and y), divides them in a straight line and save to file. Like this: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bruderooo/Studies-AI-homework/master/Plots/0.png)
#### 2. In file teach.py generate list with weights (from -1 to 1)
#### 3. Counts f(u) (f - activation function; u = x * w2 + y * w1 + w0)
#### 4. Draws a linear function based on y = -x1*w1/w2 - w0/w2. At the begining it can look like this: ![alt text](https://github.com/bruderooo/Studies-AI-homework/blob/master/plots/1.png)
#### 5. Corrects weights 
#### 6. Return to point 3 (5 times)

### You can see in folder plots how they look like
