## How the program works?
#### 1. Generate two lists randome numbers from -5 to 5 (x1 and x2). Like this: ![alt text](https://github.com/bruderooo/Studies-AI-homework/blob/master/basicPlot.png?raw=true)
#### 2. Generate list with weights (from -1 to 1)
#### 3. Counts f(u) (f - activation function; u = x2 * w2 + x1 * w1 + w0)
#### 4. Draws a linear function based on y = -x1*w1/w2 - w0/w2 At the begining it can look like this: ![alt text](https://github.com/bruderooo/Studies-AI-homework/blob/master/Plots/plot1.png)
#### 5. Corrects weights 
#### 6. Return to point 3 (100 times)
